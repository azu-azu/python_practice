# Python Practice Project

This repository is a practice project for learning, experimenting, and visualizing algorithms using Python.

## Overview

- The main purpose is to deepen understanding of basic algorithms and data processing in Python through implementation, debugging, and visualization.
- Most algorithm implementations, tests, and visualizations are located in the `sort/` directory.
- For details on algorithms and usage, please refer to `sort/README.md`.

## Directory Structure

- `sort/` : Implementations, debugging, and visualization of sorting algorithms, related documents, VBA examples, etc.
- `requirements.txt` : Required Python packages (e.g., matplotlib)

## Setup Example

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

- For details on each algorithm and implementation, see `sort/README.md`.
- This project is intended as a collection of samples for learning, testing, and visualization.
